                           attended a Hour of Code event at Kaspi Education
                           Center in Khatai: for teaching basic concepts of

                           - The audience was chosen on the basis of needs and
                           compatibility. In this event, participants were first
                           greeted and introduced to ADA University, technology,
                           and computer
                           science-related academic programs and career

                           by Nicat through
                           features and simple coding exercises. Ferid and
                           Aysu
                           provided one-on-one personal assistance and coaching

                           coding.
                           Many were surprised by the ease of learning and

                           possibilities.

                           - The Hour of Code event went on pretty smoothly and
                           was relatively stress-free. Minor problems in the
                           internet connection were sorted out quickly by using
                           mobile hotspots.
                           This
                           preparedness and time management helped catch up with
                           schedules and build confidence for similar events,
                           emphasizing the importance of backups. Participants
                           felt confident and
                           became
                           curious after going through the introductory
                           activities on <a class="hoc__link"
                              href="https://code.org/"
                              target="_blank">code.org</a>. They were interested
                           in learning more and
                           wanted to
                           continue. The team spirit contributed to the positive
                           flow
                           of
                           activities, though there is room for improvement for
                           more time management and initial troubleshooting
                           sessions.
                           The Hour of Code turned out to be a very enriching
                           experience, both for the participants and educators
                           in the basics of coding, problem-solving, and
                           computer science. It was
                           teamwork-lead, supported by Kaspi Education Center,
                           eager participants, supportive group members, and ADA
                           University. The event had left the participants with
                           a sense of
                           achievement
                           and eagerness to learn more.
